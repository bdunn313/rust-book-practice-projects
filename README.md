# Rust Book Projects

This is just a collection of mini projects or functions that I'm working on as I work through the [official rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

It's really just intended for myself and my learning, but I'd love extra eyes and feedback if someone can suggest a better way or finds any of the projects interesting!

> sidenote: this is the best official intro book I've ever read for a programming language!
